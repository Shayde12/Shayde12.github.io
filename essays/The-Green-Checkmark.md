## Arbitrary Coding Style:
Since the first coding class I have ever taken, there has always been a site where the coding standards are detailed to you. I admittedly did not really look at the coding standard and just copied the way the teacher's had their code. It was mostly because I thought it would be kind of a pain to do and I'm kind of lazy. 

## An Epiphany:
Just recently with my new experiences in ESlint I've had an epiphany, coding standards are really not arbitrary at all and should be required for all code you write. When going out into the real world, other people besides you have to be able to read your code and understand what it does. If you didn't have a coding standard it would magnify the amount of time it would take for other people to read and understand your code. It would be essential if you were coding some sort project with other people. It would be quite confusing when looking at the code if there were four different styles of code which would again magnify the amount of time it would take to read and understand the code. 


## ESlint:
ESlint is the tool we are using in ICS 314 to enforce the coding standard. It is relatively easy to setup and use although I've had some errors with it, it is mostly on my fault than it is the applications. ESlint will look at your entire code and check if there are any lines of code that betray the coding standard.


## Is It Useful or Not?:
For most of my coding journey, I really didn't believe that the coding standard was that important. But, I have found that the opposite is true. And with applications like ESlint, my being lazy is not really an excuse anymore because it will tell you as you code. All in all, coding standards are important and not as arbitrary as I originally thought.
