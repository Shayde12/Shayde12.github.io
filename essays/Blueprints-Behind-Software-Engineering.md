## The Building Blocks of Software Design
There are three types of design patterns and in those three patterns there are a ton of sub patterns within these three types main types. The three types are: creational, behavioral, and structual. The creational patterns are those that deal with object creation and tries to make sure that the object creation is suitable to the task at hand. Behavioral patterns, deal with the way object's interact with each other and make sure it is as efficient as possible. Structual patterns increase the individuality of the system so that even if something changes it won't break the entire thing. 

## Building a Program with the Blueprints
After looking into what design patterns are, I realized that I have actually been using them quite a bit. 
Such as when I created a button when working on one of my assignments that allowed users to edit a card, which is a form of a behavioral design pattern. Specifically it could be a observer pattern as the button would inform the various parts of the application that there is a change taking place and ensure that the parts that need to be working are. Within a similar assignment, I had to setup a domain for a website I along with my group are working on. This is can be connected to a structual design pattern as I also had to set up a proxy in order for the domain to go through. Despite not knowing what design patterns were earlier, I have actually been using them quite a lot.
