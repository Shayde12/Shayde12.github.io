## An Uncertain Future 
As a child, I was told to broaden my horizons and I feel that learning to code is something that will do just that. As of the time I am writing this, I have only been coding for about a year. While interesting, I do not think that I would want to do it for the next few decades. I could change my mind and having my degree in computer science is a good starting point. 

## Going Forward
Despite my current lack of interest in software engineering, I would still like to continue to learn to code. I believe that learning to code would be a good tool in my repertoire. I have found a great interest in the fields of IT and cybersecurity within the computer science fields. While not really related to code at all, I do really like those two fields and pursue them later down the line. 

## Coding, Maybe  
Since this class is a requirement to fulfill my degree in computer science, I need to take it. But, over these past two weeks in the class I have thoroughly enjoyed myself in both taking on challenging obstacles and overcoming them. The WODs are some of my favorite parts of class and will help in developing my problem-solving skills. Though I do enjoy most of what I know about coding, it's not enough to drive me to want to do this after college.
