## 90s Throwback
HTML and CSS have been an interesting experience to say the least. I think it is easier to do raw HTML and CSS, however the website resulting from that looks less than stellar. But then again, the only website I had to code in raw HTML and CSS was quite simplistic and not that difficult to do. And from the raw files that I've seen looking at websites do not look fun to do whatsoever. 

## 2000s, A New Look
Experiencing Bootstrap 5 has been a headache and the amount you have finangle the settings are frustrating. But similarly to coding, it is quite satisfying to finally get it right after messing with it for who knows how long. The helpful websites do make it a lot easier to figure out some of the stuff but there is still a lot to find out on your own. The websites though, are admittedly much crisper than when using raw HTML and CSS. 

## 90s or 2000s? Which is better?  
Which is better? The answer should be clear, using UI frameworks such as Bootstrap 5 is superior to trying to code in raw HTML and CSS. Not only is the overall look of the website much better but it also, beats trying to code everything from scratch. Bootstrap allows for more customizability quicker because of the pre-written code that you have available to you. There are some drawbacks, like mentioned earlier, the copious amount of time that you have to finangle with it to make it work. This could be attributed to a lack of experience in Bootstrap so, the tradeoff is worth it.
