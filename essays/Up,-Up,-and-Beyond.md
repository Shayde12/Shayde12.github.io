##  Prepping for Takeoff
Throughout the semester, we have been learning and applying some of the things that go into being a software engineer. From things like user interface design, functional programming, and agile project management. All of these things not only go into the creation of web applications which was the main focus of the class, but also general software development and even real life. Learning these things relatively early on the journey to becoming a software engineer, I feel gives someone time to develop their skills that will definitely become relevant later on. 

##  Running the Calculations
Functional programming was one of the first things we went over in class. It is a type of methodology that helps with creating better code as the code written in this style is more compact meaning there is less to go wrong. To exemplify this way of writing code, we learned Underscore which helps to condense functions down with things like _.each or _.find. These functions were quite memorable as _.each iterates over a list and _.find looks through a list to find the value you want. Those two functions are quite helpful and will definitely have some uses in the future. By learning Underscore, it will help me to create better code that is more readable and maintainable for future use. 

##  Drawing the Blueprints
Agile project management was very helpful when trying to create the final project for this class. The particular style of agile project management we used was issue driven project management which is breaking down the project into parts and creating issues that are tracked and finished throughout. Splitting the project into parts like this helps to promotes accountability and the actual progress of the project. This can be applied anywhere that has projects or even just small assignments as drawing up a plan and breaking things down ensures you're not overwhelmed later on, trying to rush to finish everything. 

## Putting the pieces together
User interface design was an interesting topic for me because of how most things have something that someone outside of you will look at. Like when doing the final project my group had to think about how to improve a user's experience when using the website. Going through the steps and designing an end result that was aesthetically pleasing to the eye and actually usable was quite the challenge. It makes me look at other things and wonder if possible how to improve the UI design of something.  

## Successful Launch
The end of the semester is here and now it's time to take what I learned from the class and apply it to the things coming next. Like the changes in how I write code now to increase readability and be less buggy. As well as the efficiency in taking on projects and not trying to do them all in one day, instead breaking them down into parts, taking it one step at a time. Finally bringing those two together to create and wonder how I could improve user interfaces in the things I see outside. All in all this has been a great experience and I have learned a lot.
