##  Introduction
This question I came across while looking through StackOverflow seemed to be one of the few paragons of good question asking, that I've seen. The question that I found was here, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72493528/angular-14-uncaught-in-promise-nullinjectorerror-r3injectorerrorstandalon, and the overall format of the question was good. And asked for some advice on how to fix an issue that was coming up after the update from angular 13 - angular 14. The issue was an exception error after trying to go to a different after loading the code. The sender included the code implemented that was able to be run within the site. The answers received were efficient and straight to the point, that went to the root of the problem, giving a proposed solution.  

##  Issue Drive Project Management
While browsing through StackOverflow, I came across a question that did not really follow the guidelines set by Eric Raymond, and his study into how to ask smart questions. His question was here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77883277/injecting-javascript-into-html, but basically it was just asking how to transform a piece of javascript code into html. His question was not meeting the guidelines because they did not provide enough relevant information and only showed the piece of code they were trying to inject. Not only that, but the code was also not in the correct format. This question, did receive some answers, but most of the answers were telling the person to fix their code and improve their question. There were a few answers that were a little helpful but mostly was just to tell the person to go to How Tos for asking questions and writing code in the correct format.

## UI Design
Looking at StackOverflow and all of the questions on the site, there was a wide array of different questions. The questions ranged from good to bad and from what I was looking at there were more in the middle questions that weren't good nor bad. Both kinds of questions had answers but they would get answers regardless, whether or not it was an accurate answer, I'm not sure but the quality of answers definitely dffered. Although having such a site that is specifically for questions based in computer science is incredibly helpful it only is if you know how to ask questions properly.
