## JavaScript, the Inside:

I have only just begun my coding journey starting in my sophomore year of college. Throughout this year and a half of coding and learning Java, I have experienced many highs and lows such as not understanding why the code doesn’t work to the joys of it finally working after testing for hours. This experience has honed my skills in Java. JavaScript, comparatively, is like a breath of fresh air with the laxness in the syntax and the easier calls for functions. 

## A Look Into JavaScript, From A Different Perspective:

While I do believe that there might be some issues with JavaScript. I believe that from a software engineering perspective that JavaScript is a good language with some tradeoffs. These tradeoffs being that since you don’t need to give a value a concrete call it requires less code, but it is less safe. Another of these tradeoffs would be that Java is more structured but requires much more lines of code. There are tradeoffs between both languages and whether or not you want to use them will depend on what your current project is. 

## Athletic Software Engineering, A New Way to Learn

This is a new learning style that is implemented in ICS 314 at UH Manoa, that has students develop their programming skills over time. So it's more of a slow and steady wins the race kind of thing, and it has these workouts that will test your knowledge of the topics at hand. These workouts are called WODs and will be discussed later on. But, so far this athletic software engineering in the past two weeks have been quite engaging and helped me to develop more as a programmer. 

## The WODs of Doom:

The practice WODs are quite helpful and I really enjoy them. It's a little challenging sometimes, but that might be due to the fact that I am somewhat lacking in experience. The practice WODs are helpful because they give a refresher on how to code certain things and keep the knowledge present and used. I do believe that this way of learning is the best for me because I seem to learn best by constant repetition of something over a period of time. The WODs are a little scary at first but, I think that practice will make perfect.
