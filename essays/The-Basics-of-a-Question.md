##  
This question I came across while looking through StackOverflow seemed to be one of the few paragons of good question asking, I've seen while browsing through the site. 

##  
While browsing through StackOverflow, I came across a question that did not really follow the guidelines set by Eric Raymond, and his study into how to ask smart questions. His question was here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77883277/injecting-javascript-into-html, but basically it was just asking how to transform a piece of javascript code into html. His question was not meeting the guidelines because they did not provide enough relevant information and only showed the piece of code they were trying to inject. Not only that, but the code was also not in the correct format. This question, did receive some answers, but most of the answers were telling the person to fix their code and improve their question. There were a few answers that were a little helpful but mostly was just to tell the person to go to How Tos for asking questions and writing code in the correct format.
