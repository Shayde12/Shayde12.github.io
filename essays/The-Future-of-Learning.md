### I. Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary tool that has significantly transformed the educational landscape. It offers personalized learning experiences and enhances both teaching and learning processes. Software engineering, in particular, benefits from AI as it aids in writing and explaining code. Personally, I have used ChatGPT to help debug code and as an interactive learning guide for researching specific topics.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:
  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

I minimally used AI for the Experience WODs, preferring to solve problems independently to enhance my learning. When stuck, I often referred to attached videos rather than AI, which helped me resolve issues effectively.

  2. In-class Practice WODs

My use of AI was negligible, as I believed I could manage these WODs independently. With additional time outside of class, I was able to complete them successfully.

  3. In-class WODs

Despite trying to avoid using ChatGPT, the time constraints and high stakes of in-class WODs occasionally necessitated its use, although not without issues.
    
  4. Essays

 For essays, I sometimes consulted AI for ideas on titles or for more concise explanations of topics. Generally, I preferred to create my own titles.

  5. Final Project

ChatGPT assisted me in developing a function to filter items by their owners, ensuring proper display on their respective pages.

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial

For a design patterns essay, I used ChatGPT to consolidate information from various sources, helping me understand different design patterns more effectively.

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

I did not really answer questions in class or in the discord, but I think it would be better to try and answer the questions based on one's own knowledge rather than having to automatically resort to AI.

  8. Asking or answering a smart question

Usually if I had a question I would be able to articulate it well enough or show it well enough that I did not have to have AI help me to formulate a question.

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

I requested coding examples from ChatGPT, particularly for complex functions like Underscore's .pluck, which enhanced my understanding.

  10. Explaining code

At the beginning of the semester, when doing Javascript if I did not understand how some code worked, I would ask ChatGPT to explain it to me. I could usually understand what the code did after the explanations.

  11. Writing code

I have used ChatGPT to help me write code in the in-class WODs, however, this was after I did not pass them. I wanted to try and do as much as possible under my own efforts. ChatGPT would help a little but what matters the most is how good you are at asking specific questions.

  12. Documenting code

I did not use ChatGPT to document my code as documenting code is not that hard as long as you understand what the code does.

  13. Quality assurance

I did use ChatGPT to help with making sure that my code was able to pass ESlint tests, it was often able to find the errors and correct them.

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above

I have not used AI in any other way within ICS 314

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
The impact of AI on my learning has been mixed. Negatively, it sometimes encouraged taking shortcuts, which diminished my problem-solving persistence. Positively, AI was invaluable for demystifying complex topics like Underscore.
### IV. Practical Applications:
AI's application in software engineering is rapidly expanding, exemplified by GitHub's AI, which suggests code snippets, enhancing developer productivity and allowing focus on more strategic tasks.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
AI tools have limitations, particularly in areas like HTML or React, where they often generate non-functional or inappropriate code. An interesting future application could be integrating a restricted AI directly into courses to balance assistance with skill development.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
Looking at the traditional teaching style and an AI teaching style, there are definitely a lot of trade offs. For example, a more traditional teaching style will probably promote more practical skill development than an AI one. As it is really easy to just ask the AI for the answer and be done with it, but with a more traditional teaching style it kind of forces you to try to do things on your own. The AI teaching style might have more engagement as it can create a learning guide just for you and follows the way you might be able to learn. 

### VII. Future Considerations:
Personally, I believe AI could have a massive impact on the way software engineering is taught. It really all depends on how teachers or professors change their curriculum to accomodate for the usage of AI. They will probably have to test more for how someone is able to utilize AI to their benefit because of the way that AI can write code. Finding a way to integrate AI into their teaching style will also be another challenge as it is so new and the professors might not have that much experience with it. This will make coding easier though, for people who are trying to learn which opens the software development field even more. 

### VIII. Conclusion:
AI has made significant waves in software engineering education, simplifying code understanding and generation. While this has made learning more accessible, it risks undermining practical skill development. Integrating AI into courses with constraints on its capabilities could be a balanced approach, promoting skill development while utilizing AI benefits.
