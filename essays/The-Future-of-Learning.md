### I. Introduction
Artificial intelligence has rapidly changed the way that people learn a

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
My use of AI for the Experience WODs were little to none as I thought it would be better for myself and my learning if I did it myself. Often I was able to do these experience WODs on my own but if there was something I was absolutely stuck on, I would try and watch the videos attached to the experience WODs. Through these I was often able to figure out whatever error I was having and fix it.  
  2. In-class Practice WODs
My AI use in the in-class practice WODs was pretty zero as I thought it was possible to do it on my own. Even if I did not finish them in class, it was possible to continue my efforts on them outside of class. With that extra time, the WODs became more doable. 
  3. In-class WODs

  4. Essays
I have utilized AI in some of the essays, but it is usually for ideas for a essay title or to explain a topic to me more concisely. However, most of the time I did not use the titles ChatGPT gave me as I did not really like them and I would create my own.
  5. Final project
In the final project of ICS 314, I used ChatGPT to help me to figure out a way to filter out items by their owners. It helped me to create a function that was able to keep track of someone's email to ensure that their items were showcased on their items page. 
  6. Learning a concept / tutorial
In the design patterns essay I asked ChatGPT to explain them to me so that I could have most of the information right in front of me and not have six or seven different tabs at once. ChatGPT also helped me to get a better idea of each of the different design patterns and how they worked. 
  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

  10. Explaining code

  11. Writing code

  12. Documenting code

  13. Quality assurance 

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above
I have not used AI in any other way within ICS 314
