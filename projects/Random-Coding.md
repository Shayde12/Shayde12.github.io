Recently to get better at coding, I have decided to start to try and do more simple projects related to coding. The only way to get better at something like coding is to just continuously practice it and to get better I have decided to try to do some of the projects recommended for beginners. Projects such as a sudoku solver, a basic calculator, or a to do list. As this is a recent decision, I don't really have that much progress as of yet but throughout the year I am going to update this with the coding projects I have finished. This decision has also been made because of my less than stellar attempts at the in class assignments.
